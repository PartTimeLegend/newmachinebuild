A new machine is a PITA. This makes it less, at least for me it does.

This is basically a [Chocolately](https://chocolatey.org) wrapper script. Don't pay it much attention. Oh it also installs WSL if you uncomment that bit. GitHub can't do WSL.

## Docker
```bash
docker pull parttimelegend/newmachinebuild
```
