# New Machine Build

[![CICD](https://github.com/PartTimeLegend/newmachinebuild/actions/workflows/cicd.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/PartTimeLegend/newmachinebuild/actions/workflows/cicd.yml)

A new machine is a PITA. This makes it less, at least for me it does.

This is basically a [Chocolately](https://chocolatey.org) or [Brew](https://brew.sh/) wrapper script.

As this is my personal set up I will not be accepting package PR's. I'm sorry, but I'm not installing things I don't need. You can fork it though.
